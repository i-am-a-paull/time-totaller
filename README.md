#time-totaller

Basically, my wife has [dyscalculia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscalculia).  This doesn't mean that she is stupid or just didn't bother to learn math; she straight-up cannot do math, and it's not her fault.  The time-entry system at her job only takes totals per day in decimals rounded down to the nearest quarter-hour, rather than time-in/time-out, so I wrote this to do the math for her.

Also, I wrote it to learn how to write apps entirely in javascript.

time-totaller makes use of [underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), and [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js).
